1. Press any of the existing GIF buttons to fetch 10 animated GIFs related to the topic on the button.

3. Enter any topic you'd like into the text box and click on "Add a GIF button!" to create a new GIF button at the top. You may then click on that button to fetch ten new GIFs relating to that topic. New topics may be a single word or multiple words. You may add as many GIF buttons as you'd like.
