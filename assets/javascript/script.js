//Creates an array of strings which will be topics for GIF searches, in this case, baseball teams.

//Creates buttons for each topic

//When the user clicks on one of the buttons, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API related to that topic and places them on the page. Each GIFs rating appears below it.

//When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

//Adds a form to the page that takes the value from a user input box and adds it into the `topics` array.

//Makes a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.
